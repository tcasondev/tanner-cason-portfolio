    <h2>Channel 3 Media</h2>
    <div class="bookshelf">
      <div class="book">
        <p> Channel 3 media is what grew from a small class project during my Mass Communication studies. We are a podcast network that strives to support small podcasters. 
          Mostly, this project was started and still continues as a personal outlet for me and some friends to put our thoughts out "on paper" but I have enjoyed the many learning
        experiences it has provided.</p>
        <p>When it comes to how Channel 3 is actually "built" the approach has been scattered. We initially approached the project hard and fast, trying to take advantage of every outlet and opportunity 
          we could find. We quickly realized that we were spreading ourselves too thin and decided to do more research. As we coontinued (and still continue) to grow and learn, we have iterated our process
          behind the curtain numerous times. With each re-start, as we learned more about what we actually needed, our focus shifted from ease to efficiency.
          Each iteration has used exclusively consumer-available tools and minor HTML scripting to attempt to build a platform that listeners can easily navigate and enjoy and that will provide
          other small podcasters either a platform, a template, or both from which to pursue their goals.

        <h2>Vaporun</h2>
          <p>Vaporun is a small game that I am developing for mobile devices using C# and the Unity engine. The way that I approached this was an absolut blast. Despite the fact that it's a 
            2D game, I built a full 3D environment in Unity using custom built assets, which I also learned to make. The result combined the coding of 2D gameplay with the creativity of 3D worldbuilding
            The goal of this game was to serve as a learning experience for me but also to provide
            a mobile-friendly game which is reasonably fun and will never hound players with ads or subscriptions. You could say I was inspired by frustration alone. This one is for the people. More information to come!</p>
