      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="book">
        <p> In college I studied Mass Communication and Journalism. Beginning with a class project, I started to explore new hobbies which eventually lead to starting a podcast network with some friends. Through necessity I learned to build our small infrastructure from the ground up and that lead me to discover my love for web and software development.</p>
        <p> I decided to pursue development as a career and shifted my academic interests to Thinkful to learn how to make that happen. I hit the ground running there and haven't looked back since. Now I'm looking forward to offering Full Stack web development or engine-based game development solutions!</p>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy running a podcast network with my friends and I'm getting pretty good with a drone.</p>
        <p>If you're looking to add somebody to your professional team, please reach out! I'm always thrilled to work with great people on great projects.</p>
