    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> In college I studied Mass Communication and Journalism. Beginning with a class project, I started to explore new hobbies which eventually lead to starting a podcast network with some friends. Through necessity I learned to build our small infrastructure from the ground up and that lead me to discover my love for web and softare development.</p>
    <p> I decided to pursue development as a career and shifted my academic interests to Thinkful to learn how to make that happen. I hit the ground running there and haven't looked back since.</p>
    <p>If you're looking to add somebody to your professional team, please reach out! I'm always thrilled to work with great people on great projects.</p>
